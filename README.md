## Assignment 6 Repository

This assignment is a wrap up with data wrangling techniques working with strings 
and creating functions. Instructions for this assignment was taken from [here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw06/hw06.html).

The two tasks I attempted were:
1. Working through the exercises in the [Strings chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#exercises-30) in R for Data Science
2. Writing functions to work with the Gapminder data
