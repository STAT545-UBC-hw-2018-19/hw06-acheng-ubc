## Assignment 6 Repository

This assignment is a wrap up with data wrangling techniques working with strings 
and creating functions. Instructions for this assignment was taken from [here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw06/hw06.html).

The two tasks I attempted were:

1. Expanding the functionality of a function that works with the Gapminder data
1. Working with a nested data frame
